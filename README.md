# TlaGenerator

**TODO: Add description**

## Installation

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `tla_generator` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:tla_generator, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/tla_generator](https://hexdocs.pm/tla_generator).

## Notes

  * Consider various approaches to the use of Refinement proofs in the proof of the main algorithm.
    The latter will use the functions as atomic? Or will consider the Done flags or <>[] operators?
